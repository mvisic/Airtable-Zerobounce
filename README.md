# Airtable-Zerobounce
I'd like to create a custom extension for Airtable that uses ZeroBounce to validate email addresses.

Information about the ZeroBounce Javascript API can be [found here](https://github.com/zerobounce/zerobounce-javascript-api-v2)

Documentation for creating a custom Airtable extension can be [found here](https://support.airtable.com/docs/create-your-own-custom-extensions-with-the-blocks-sdk)
